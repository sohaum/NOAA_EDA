In this repository, we analyze 2018 lightning strike data collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on different states of the USA. The analysis includes various data manipulation and visualization techniques using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Notebooks

### 1. Date String Manipulations and Visualization
[Date string manipulations and Visualization.ipynb](https://github.com/sohaum/NOAA_EDA/blob/main/Date%20string%20manipulations%20and%20Visualization.ipynb)

This notebook covers:
- Parsing and formatting date strings with `pandas`
- Aggregating data by time periods (e.g., monthly totals)
- Visualizing aggregated data using bar graphs

### 2. Dealing with Missing Data in Python
[Dealing with missing data in Python.ipynb](https://github.com/sohaum/NOAA_EDA/blob/main/Dealing%20with%20missing%20data%20in%20Python.ipynb)

This notebook includes:
- Identifying missing data within datasets
- Techniques to handle missing data (e.g., imputation, removal)
- Impact analysis of missing data on overall dataset integrity

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
[EDA.ipynb](https://github.com/sohaum/NOAA_EDA/blob/main/EDA.ipynb)

This notebook focuses on:
- Preliminary data investigation to understand the data structure
- Statistical summaries and visualizations to identify patterns and anomalies
- Insights and observations derived from the 2018 NOAA lightning strike data
